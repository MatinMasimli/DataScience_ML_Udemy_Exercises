This is the first capstone project on Data Science and Machine Learning Udemy Course. The project covers all the materials
such as Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn that are taught for Data Science part of the course. 
The attached images are the outputs of some of the questions. The following are the questions of the project:

1. Check the info() of the df.
2. Check the head of df.
3. What are the top 5 zipcodes for 911 calls?
4. What are the top 5 townships (twp) for 911 calls?
5. Take a look at the 'title' column, how many unique title codes are there?
6. In the titles column there are "Reasons/Departments" specified before the title code. These are EMS, Fire, and Traffic. Use
   .apply() with a custom lambda expression to create a new column called "Reason" that contains this string value. 
   For example, if the title column value is EMS: BACK PAINS/INJURY, the Reason column value would be EMS.
